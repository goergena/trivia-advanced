The way you want a trivia game to work! A trivia game that shows each question one-by-one with a countdown timer to answer each question. There is immediate feedback after each answer submission, indicating the correct answer if yours was incorrect. At the end of the game, you see your total score- correct questions, incorrect questions, and unanswered.

This project uses JavaScript, timeouts, and jQuery. Styled with Bootstrap and some custom CSS.
